    "Modules provide a high level option of separation of concerns in Python. Similarly to functions, modules allow to store your code in some reusable container to achieve that separation. Technically, any .Py file can be treated as a module. Probably you've already seen some examples of importing some module into your file - you may notice how only some simple name (without the file extention or the path) is being used. The Python interpreter will perform a search automatically based on the provided name. Some main areas of that search would be the current working directory (from where the file is being executed), standard library and site-packages folders (near to the installation place of the interpreter). It can be configured additionally if some non-standard file placement needs to be supported (rarely). "

    "Python, as a high-level programming language, offers several advantages when working with the operating system (OS) and files. Its standard library provides a wide range of modules and functions that simplify common tasks related to file and OS operations. Python's `os` module allows you to interact with the underlying operating system (even without knowing which os is being used), enabling you to perform operations such as file and directory management, process control, and environment configuration. The `os.path` module provides a convenient way to manipulate file paths, making it easy to work with files and directories across different operating systems. Python's file handling capabilities, including the built-in `open()` function and file object methods, allow you to read from and write to files efficiently, with support for various file modes and encodings."

    "\n",
    "- Resource Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you open a file, the operating system allocates certain resources to handle the file operations, such as memory buffers and file descriptors.\n",
    "    If you don't close the file properly, these resources may remain allocated even after your program has finished executing.\n",
    "    Failing to close files can lead to resource leaks, where the allocated resources are not freed up for other programs or processes to use.\n",
    "    Over time, if you open many files without closing them, it can lead to resource exhaustion, potentially causing your program or even the operating system to become unresponsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Integrity:\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you write data to a file, it is often buffered in memory before being written to the physical storage device.\n",
    "    If you don't close the file properly, there's a risk that some of the buffered data may not be written to the file, leading to data loss or inconsistencies.\n",
    "    Closing the file ensures that all the buffered data is flushed and written to the file, guaranteeing data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- File Locking and Concurrency:\n",
    "\n",
    "    In some cases, when you open a file, the operating system may lock the file to prevent other processes or programs from accessing it simultaneously.\n",
    "    If you don't close the file, the lock may remain in place, preventing other parts of your program or other programs from accessing the file.\n",
    "    This can lead to concurrency issues, where multiple processes or threads are unable to access the file simultaneously, potentially causing delays or deadlocks."

    "- `'r'` (Read Mode): This is the default mode. It opens the file for reading. If the file does not exist, it raises a FileNotFoundError.\n",

    "- `'a'` (Append Mode): Opens the file for appending. If the file exists, the new data is written at the end of the file, preserving the existing contents. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "- `'x'` (Exclusive Creation Mode): Opens the file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, a FileExistsError is raised.\n",
    "- `'b'` (Binary sub-Mode): Used in conjunction with other modes (like `'wb'`) to open the file in binary mode, allowing you to read or write binary data.\n",
    "- `'t'` (Text sub-Mode): Used in conjunction with other modes (like `'rt'`) to open the file in text mode, allowing you to read or write string data. This is the default mode.\n",
    "- `'+'` (Plus sub-Mode): Used in conjunction with other modes (like `'a+'` or `'rb+'`), add missing operations while presuming the main mode logic, e.g. `'w+'` would allow reading from the file while still truncating it on opening.\n",

Format the text taking into account the maximum number of characters per line, but if a word does not fit entirely in a line, it should be moved to the next one, and the spacing between words should be evenly increased for the current line(similarly to the \"Justify\" function in text editors). There is a module called ‘textwrap’ which can do it, you may take a look at it but do not use for this task.\n",
