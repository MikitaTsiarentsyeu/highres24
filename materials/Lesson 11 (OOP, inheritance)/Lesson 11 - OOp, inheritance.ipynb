    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes, establishing a hierarchical relationship between them. It enables the creation of new classes (called subclasses or derived classes) based on existing classes (called superclasses or base classes), promoting code reuse, extensibility, and modularity. Inheritance supports the concept of generalization and specialization, where the superclass represents a more general concept (abstraction of a highest level), and the subclasses represent more specialized or specific versions of that concept (lower level of abstraction). Inheritance also facilitates polymorphism, allowing objects of different subclasses to be treated as objects of their common superclass, enabling flexibility and interchangeability in the design and implementation of software systems."
