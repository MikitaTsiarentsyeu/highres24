    "is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task and can be called multiple times throughout a program. Functions can take input parameters/arguments, which are values passed to the function when it is called, allowing the function to perform operations on different data. Functions can also return values using the return statement, allowing the result of the function's computation to be used in other parts of the program. Functions promote code reusability, modularity, and abstraction, making your code more efficient, readable, and maintainable."

The new function object gets associated with a variable (the name of the function becomes the name of the variable). The object contains the body of the function, you can use the object itself in any way you like, but in most cases you will just call the function by putting `()` after the name (and maybe listing some parameters)."

This allows for name resolution and helps avoid naming conflicts between different scopes."
