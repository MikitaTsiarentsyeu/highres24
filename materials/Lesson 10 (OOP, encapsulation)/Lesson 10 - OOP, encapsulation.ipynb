    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes that encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods). OOP promotes the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, allowing for modular, reusable, and maintainable code. In OOP, classes define the blueprint or template for creating objects, specifying their attributes and methods, while objects are specific instances of a class, each with its own unique set of attribute values. Inheritance enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, where subclasses inherit the attributes and methods of their parent classes, promoting code reuse and specialization. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling flexibility and extensibility in the design and implementation of software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python as an OOP language support all three concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism), though it does not provide the 'canonical' syntax toolkit for that. OOP in Python is rather simple and built mostly on conventions, allowing much more flexible designs than languages like C# and Java. "

    "Having a blueprint describing a common attrs(data)/methods(behevior) for an abstract object, and separate entities (instances) with their own independent state is the core of OOP in any language. Such a blueprint is usually called an abstraction, it can describe a real object of a physical world or something non-existent in reality like a bank tracnsaction or an http request. Abstraction may vary in level of details, e.g. a Dog abstraction from the example above is not very detailed as it has only two attrs and two methods. It's very important to match level of detalisation with the solution, if two methods are enough to reach some goals than it's enough. High-level abstractions (i.e.  not detailed classes) can be extended after implementation with techniques like inheritance."

    "Encapsulation is a fundamental principle in Object-Oriented Programming that involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, known as a class. It aims to hide the internal details and complexity of an object from the outside world, providing a clear and controlled interface for interacting with the object. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction, where the internal state of an object is protected from direct access or modification by external code, and can only be accessed or modified through well-defined methods or properties. By encapsulating data and behavior within a class, encapsulation promotes data integrity, security, and modularity, as it prevents unauthorized access and modification of an object's internal state, and allows for better control and management of the object's behavior.\n",
