    "Polymorphism is a fundamental principle in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling flexibility and extensibility in the design and implementation of software systems. It enables the use of a single interface or base class to represent multiple related classes, providing a way to write more generic and reusable code. Polymorphism is closely related to inheritance, as it relies on the ability of subclasses to override or extend the methods defined in their superclasses. There are two main types of polymorphism: compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (method overriding and virtual functions). Compile-time polymorphism allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within a class, while runtime polymorphism enables subclasses to provide their own implementations of methods inherited from the superclass. *Note that Python has only runtime polymorphism and will not have the compile type in the nearest future.* \n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism promotes code modularity, extensibility, and maintainability by allowing the addition of new classes that adhere to a common interface without modifying the existing codebase, facilitating the development of more flexible and adaptable software systems."

    "In Python, polymorphism is achieved through duck typing, which is a concept that focuses on the behavior of objects rather than their actual types. Duck typing allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably as long as they provide the required methods or attributes, without the need for explicit inheritance or type checking. Python's dynamic typing and lack of explicit method signatures enable polymorphism to be implemented in a more flexible and less restrictive manner compared to statically-typed languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism in Python is commonly demonstrated through method overriding, where subclasses provide their own implementations of methods inherited from the superclass, and through the use of abstract base classes and interfaces, which define a common interface that can be implemented by multiple classes."

    "In the example above we forced the specific implementation of the interface `say_something` onto the Animal class which may not be a good approach in most cases (the logic may be too specific for the high level of abstraction). It's more common approach to have the abstract parent only as a support for an interface without providing a specific implementation. Additionally, it's important to be sure that all derived classes will actually implement the interface (or it will lead to errors). To help with such cases you can use the `abc` concept. `abc` stands for 'abstract base class' and it provides a way to enforce an interface implementation in derived classes."
