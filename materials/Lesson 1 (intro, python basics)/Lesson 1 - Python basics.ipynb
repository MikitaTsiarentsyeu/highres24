    "1. It reads the Python code line by line.\n",
    "2. It checks the syntax of each line and translates it into bytecode, which is a low-level representation of the code that can be executed by the Python virtual machine.\n",
    "3. If there are no syntax errors, the interpreter executes the bytecode, performing the specified operations and generating the desired output.\n",
    "4. If there are syntax errors or runtime errors, the interpreter raises an exception and provides an error message indicating the location and nature of the error.\n",

Indentation plays a crucial role in determining the grouping and hierarchy of statements within a Python program. A block is a group of statements that are executed together and have the same level of indentation. Python uses a consistent indentation style, typically four spaces per level, to indicate which statements belong to a particular block. The indentation level determines the scope and nesting of statements, such as the body of a function, the statements inside a loop, or the code within a conditional block. Proper indentation is mandatory in Python, and incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors or unexpected behavior."

    "Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means that variables in Python can hold values of any type. In contrast to statically-typed languages, where variables have a fixed type declared at compile-time which also affects types of objects themselves, Python determines the type of a an object (not a variable!) at runtime based on the value assigned to it. Variables in Python do not have types at all, they only reference some object in memory. This dynamic typing allows for flexibility and ease of use, as you don't need to specify the type of a variable explicitly. Python's dynamic typing system also enables variables to be reassigned with values of different types throughout the program, providing adaptability and reducing the need for explicit type conversions."
