    "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly until a certain condition is met, known as the base case. It breaks down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, solving each subproblem recursively until the base case is reached. Recursive functions typically have two main components: the base case, which defines the condition to stop the recursion, and the recursive case, which defines how the function calls itself with a modified input. Recursion can be a powerful and elegant way to solve certain problems, especially those that have a naturally recursive structure, such as traversing trees or generating permutations. However, it's important to ensure that the base case is properly defined to avoid infinite recursion and that the recursive calls progress towards the base case to guarantee the termination of the function. Recursion can sometimes lead to more concise and readable code compared to iterative solutions, but it may also be less efficient in terms of memory usage and execution time for large inputs due to the overhead of function calls and stack management."

    "When a recursive function is called, Python maintains a call stack to keep track of the function calls and their respective variables and states. Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack until the base case is reached, at which point the function returns, and the stack frames are popped off one by one. Python has a maximum recursion depth limit, which is set to 1000 by default, to prevent infinite recursion and stack overflow errors. If the recursion depth exceeds this limit, a `RecursionError` is raised. However, this limit can be modified using the `sys.setrecursionlimit()` function, although if it came to this you should really consider another solution. Recursion in Python is not very optimal, especially considering an absence of so-called tail optimization."

    "are functions that return an iterator object, allowing you to iterate over a sequence of values without storing them all in memory at once. Generators are defined using the yield keyword, which is used to produce a value from the generator function and pause the function's execution until the next value is requested. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object that can be iterated over using a for loop or by calling the `next()` function. Generators are memory-efficient because they generate values on-the-fly, only producing the next value when it is needed, making them useful for working with large datasets or infinite sequences. They provide a convenient way to create custom iterators without the need to explicitly define iterator classes and methods."
