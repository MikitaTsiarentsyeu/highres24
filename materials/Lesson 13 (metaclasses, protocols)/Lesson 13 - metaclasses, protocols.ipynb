    "Magic methods, also known as dunder methods (double underscore methods), are special methods with double underscores before and after their names. These methods are automatically called by Python in specific situations or when certain operations are performed on objects. Magic methods allow you to define the behavior of objects in response to built-in operations and syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, protocols are a higher-level concept that define a set of methods and behaviors that a class should implement to be considered a certain type of object. Protocols are not explicitly enforced by the language itself but are rather a convention or an agreement that classes can follow to provide a specific interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between protocols and magic methods is that protocols often rely on the implementation of specific magic methods to achieve their desired behavior. In other words, magic methods are the building blocks that enable classes to adhere to protocols."
