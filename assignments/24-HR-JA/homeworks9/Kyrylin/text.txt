Python was created in the early 1990s by
Guido    van    Rossum    at   Stichting
Mathematisch  Centrum in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.
Guido  remains  Python principal author,
although  it includes many contributions
from others.
In  1995,  Guido  continued  his work on
Python  at  the Corporation for National
Research Initiatives in Reston, Virginia
where  he  released  several versions of
the software.
In  May  2000, Guido and the Python core
development  team moved to BeOpen.com to
form  the  BeOpen  PythonLabs  team.  In
October of the same year, the PythonLabs
team  moved  to  Digital  Creations.  In
2001, the Python Software Foundation was
formed,    a   non-profit   organization
created      specifically     to     own
Python-related   Intellectual  Property.
Zope  Corporation is a sponsoring member
of the PSF.
All  Python  releases  are  Open Source.
Historically,  most, but not all, Python
releases  have also been GPL-compatible;
the  table  below summarizes the various releases.
