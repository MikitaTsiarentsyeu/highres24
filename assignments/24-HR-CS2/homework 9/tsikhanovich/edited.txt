The Grand Duchy of Lithuania (GDL) is an
integral  part of Belarusian history and
heritage  due  to  the  significant role
Belarusian   lands   played  within  the
state.  The core territories of the GDL,
including   regions   such  as  Polotsk,
Vitebsk,  and  Minsk, were predominantly
inhabited by East Slavic populations who
are the ancestors of modern Belarusians.
The  official  language  of the GDL, Old
Belarusian   (Ruthenian),  was  used  in
state   affairs,  legal  documents,  and
literature,    further   cementing   the
cultural  and  administrative connection
between   the   GDL  and  Belarus.  Many
prominent  figures  of  the GDL, such as
Francysk  Skaryna  and Lev Sapieha, were
born on Belarusian lands and contributed
to    its    cultural    and   political
development.  The  Union  of  Lublin  in
1569,       which       created      the
Polish-Lithuanian  Commonwealth, did not
diminish  the  Belarusian  influence, as
the  GDL  retained its autonomy with its
center  in Belarusian territories. After
the  partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth,  most  of  the GDL's lands
became  part of the Russian Empire, with
the Belarusian regions maintaining their
historical  continuity.  Modern  Belarus
views  the  GDL as a foundational period
of   its   statehood,   emphasizing  the
continuity  between  the  medieval state
and  contemporary  Belarusian  identity.
While  Lithuania  also claims the GDL as
part   of  its  history,  the  cultural,
linguistic, and territorial ties between
the  GDL  and  Belarus  are  undeniable,
making   it   a   central   element   of
Belarusian historical legacy.
