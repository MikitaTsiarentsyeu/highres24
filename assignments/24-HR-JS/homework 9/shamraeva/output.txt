The  Narkomfin  Building  is  a block of
flats  at 25, Novinsky Boulevard, in the
Central   district  of  Moscow,  Russia.
Conceived  as  a  "transitional  type of
experimental  house",  it  is a renowned
example  of  Constructivist architecture
and avant-garde housing design. Though a
listed  "Cultural  Heritage Monument" on
the  Russian cultural heritage register,
it was in a deteriorating state for many
years.   Many   units  were  vacated  by
residents.   A   reconstruction,   which
lasted   more   than  three  years,  was
completed  in  the  summer of 2020, with
the  official  opening  of the renovated
apartment building took place on 9 July.
